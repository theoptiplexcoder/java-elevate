The two houses of legislature of the princely state of Mysore, the legislative assembly and the legislative council, were established in 1881 and 1907 respectively. Sessions of the two houses took place in Mysore with joint sessions taking place in the Bangalore Town Hall. After India's independence on 15 August 1947, Mysore acceded to India and capital of Mysore state was shifted to Bangalore with the two houses moving into Attara Kacheri, a British-built building in Cubbon Park that housed the High Court of Mysore.[2] With the need for a more spacious quarters, a new building with two floors to accommodate both the houses was planned and the foundation stone of the building was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India on 13 July 1951 under the guidance of Sri K.C. Reddy, the first Chief Minister of Karnataka, then Mysore state, (1947-1952) [3] Kengal Hanumanthaiah, who was elected as chief minister of Mysore after the 1952 election revised the plan.[4] The new plan included accommodating other government offices, archives, a library and a banquet hall in the same building with artistic elements added representing the tradition of Mysore state.
